## Improved Registration Form / Process

Author: David Berriman

This project is by David Berriman and is an improvement on the registration form found at: http://www.html-form-guide.com
which is also available at Github: https://github.com/simfatic/RegistrationForm

The above example had some security issues so this project adds the following:

- Improved security : uses prepared sql statements, password hashing, protection against cross site request forgery, cross site scripting, SQL injection and brute force attacks.
- Improved object oriented design
- Structure improved to MVC architecture
- Basic bootstrap styling
- Utalizes other libraries: JQuery & Bootstrap for error reporting / browser validation
- Error table - logs errors for reporting
- User can delete their account

## Installation

The tables generated byt the SQL have been moved to a file which needs running before
the project will operate. The previous project would check the table existed on every
registration which is unnecessary processing. The file to run is: include/sql.txt.

Once the database has been set up you need to edit the initialize.php file which holds 
info such as admin emails, webste name, database login details etc.

    The script will create the table in the database when you submit the registration form the first time.
